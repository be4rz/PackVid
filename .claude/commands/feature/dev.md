Invoke the `feature-dev` skill to implement the following:

<prompt>$ARGUMENTS</prompt>

Follow all 7 phases defined in the skill:
1. Discovery - Understand what needs to be built
2. Codebase Exploration - Understand relevant existing code
3. Clarifying Questions - Resolve all ambiguities
4. Architecture Design - Design implementation approaches
5. Implementation - Build the feature (after user approval)
6. Quality Review - Review with specialized agents
7. Summary - Document what was accomplished

Use related skills (`memory`, `frontend-design`) during implementation as needed.
